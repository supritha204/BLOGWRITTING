                That said, unless you’re breaking ground on a very new or different topic, there’s probably 
                quite a bit of competition out there when it comes to this type of website.
                 With this in mind, it’s really important that you consider which blogging niches 
                 will help you cut through the noise of everything already out the blogosphere.
                <br>A blog niche is a specialized topic area that you’ll be focusing on when
                 writing content. Blogging niches allow you to narrow down your audience and 
                 craft content that is much more relevant for them.
                As a result, readers are more likely to become blog subscribers and 
                you’ll be able to build authority and position yourself as a thought leader. 
                Plus, you’ll be making it much easier for search engines to identify
                 what your blog is about and increase your chances of ranking on high 
                 positions, which in turn will bring even more readers.
                There are many types of blogs you can choose to focus on, 
                ranging from the highly technical to the more personal or creative.

                baking, it makes sense that you want to start a food blog. 
                Rather than trying to write about every single dish or drink you’ve
                 ever tried, focus on a blogging niche and use your blog as an excuse 
                 to continuously try new things.

            <p class="post-description">YouTube video covers and titles might be what 
                grab your attention but descriptions are where the search engine shines. 
                YouTube SEO is quite similar in concept to how you would write for a blog post 
                 website page: titles are important but so are the details. 
                 The more you understand video SEO, the more likely your video 
                 will show up in the search results. That being said, writing 
                 great YouTube descriptions does not negate poor video content. 
                 Descriptions will get your viewer to your video but your 
                video still needs to hold up its end of the quality bargain.</p>

            <p class="post-description"> The world is animated by the wind. This invisible, mysterious force can bring a landscape alive. Its absence can cast a calm stillness over the earth. On barren mountain tops its power is barely perceptible; in forests and seas its presence becomes manifest.

                Winds are wild, and sometimes destructive. When we look deeply into the nature of wind, when we reflect on its life, its journey to us, we can see the interconnected nature of all things. The light from the sun travels to the surface of the earth, where air is heated unevenly over land and sea causing it to expand and rise at different rates until this rising and displacing air builds in billowing gusts that rock the oceans and ripple the seas. The wind can make rag-dolls of trees, ripping them from their roots.
                
                The beauty of the wind is its dynamism. It is not constant, nor predictable. One minute it lifts the place; the next there is a lull of still abiding peace. On gentle days it is god’s whisper; In more rambunctious form it is a monster’s roar, a voice that erupts with a wild and angry energy.
                
                When it blows, the air tattoos the surface of canals, lakes, seas, blowing beautiful patterns of rhythmic energy into the liquid silence. Trees bow down in submission, as leaves, branches and roots, dance to its music, its mad, manic energy. Forests roll around in circles sending signals to the clouds, waving to the skies, and laughing to the stars above.
                
                When furious it blows blackened clouds across angry skies. The wind is a river and in its torrent clouds race each other seeking shelter, refuge from the howling ghosts of moving air.</p>
